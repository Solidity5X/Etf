# Etf
Create any kinds of ETF tokens to combine all your investments into 1 tokens
Use case:
1. Let's say you are a big project with a whole ecosystem and different tokens. (ex. Ice, Spell, Wmemo, Sushi)
You can combine all these different tokens into one token (etf).
This allows you and other people to invest into your ecosystem more easily.
2. Let's say you have different investments in different industrys.
You can combine tokens from the same industry into one token to make your portfolio easier to overlook.
Instead of investing into 50 tokens you can combine them into a few etfs.
